      <h1>I'm a modal window üòç</h1>

        1. 3 buttons click event on each button. 2.each button has each model
        had hidden class. If no hidden class, then the window will be displayed
        on all time. 3. remove hodden class but remember to not put dot. dot is
        only for selector. we are not selecting anything. we are merely
        mentioning the class.Do same with overlay class. 4. Work with classes in
        htlm css as class acts like a container with properties and attributes.
        4. keypress events like esc button and they happen on all of the page.
        5. How do know what key is pressed? using event parameter passed into
        function. information about what key is pressed will be stored in event.
        As soon as a key is pressed, JS actually generates an object which
        contains all the info about the event itself and we can access that
        object in the event handler function. This works by passing the
        parameter because we are not calling the function but we are just
        defining it and telling event handler to call it when the event happens.
        JS calls the function with the event as argument as soon as the event
        happens // this event object has different attributes
